Kanye West,Last Call,were,this,"I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that ""Truth"" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then"
Kanye West,Last Call,soundin,drums,"I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, ""Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off ""Xxplosive"" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on ""This Can't Be Life."""
Kanye West,Last Call,want,rhy-,"""Tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, ""What you think of it?"""
Kanye West,Last Call,played,beats,"...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, ""Heart of the City."" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did ""Nothing Like It"" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, ""Yo play that one beat for him."" And I played ""Heart of the City."" And really I made ""Heart of the City,"" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX"
Kanye West,Last Call,gon,one,"[Hiphop: ""No I think Jay gon' like this one right here""]"
Kanye West,Last Call,faces,ooooooooooh,"And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, ""Yo what's up I'm Kanye."""
Kanye West,Last Call,'m,shit,"You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like ""oh shit."" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" And I spit this rap that said, uh ""I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, ""Man that was tight."""
Kanye West,Last Call,sound,z.,"That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, ""H to the Izzo,"" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. ""Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z."" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, ""yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them ""Jesus Walks"" and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, ""Naw."" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man..."
Kanye West,Last Call,'s,shit,"Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like ""oh shit"""
Kanye West,Last Call,looking,rapper,"Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like ""yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick"""
